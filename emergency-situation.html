                    <p>The Secretary General of the United Nations has been informed by the Russian Ambassador to the UN of Russia’s intention to formally annex the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of the Ukraine.</p>
                    <p>Reliable sources show that Russian troops are advancing into these areas in unprecedented numbers. The Ambassador asserts that such action has been implemented in an attempt to “protect Russian nationals residing in Eastern Ukraine” after the “horrific and appalling atrocities” the government in Kiev has committed upon those of Russian descent.</p>
                    <p>Large parts of Luhansk and Donetsk have lapsed into turmoil as intense skirmishes have broken out between these newly deployed Russian troops and Ukrainian forces. Initial, conservative estimates indicate that already dozens of deaths have resulted from these clashes. Though it is impossible at this early stage to confidently estimate the damage done to infrastructure, satellite images reveal that Russia has gained control over several power plants and key roadways in both of the disputed provinces.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations has convened the General Assembly for an emergency session.</p>

                    <h3>Ukrainian Revolution</h3>
                    <p>Starting in November of 2012, large scale Euro Maidan protests occurred in Ukraine in opposition to the pro-Russian president of the Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. These popular protests were engendered by a range of factors, including the Ukrainian government’s suspension of trade deals with the European Union, its intention to set up a joint commission with Russia, as well as the existence of widespread official corruption.</p>
                    <p>Protests continued from November onwards, mainly centered on the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. Violence erupted on the 22nd of January 2013 when 3 protesters were left dead during clashes with the police. On the 22nd of February 2013, Viktor Yanukovych fled the country. The Parliament of the Ukraine voted to conduct elections later in the same year and set up an interim government.</p>

                    <h3>Conflicts in Eastern Ukraine in the Recent Past</h3>
                    <p>Russian tanks, artillery, troops, and air defense systems have entered Ukraine; NATO analysts claim that such systems are “capable of being nuclear”. South-Eastern Ukraine is being controlled by pro-Russian rebels at this time, and fighting has continued in the region despite the ceasefire signed last December. The defense minister of the Ukraine, Stepan Poltorak, has claimed that last week, 32 tanks, 16 D-30 howitzers and 30 KamAZ heavy trucks were sent from Russia and headed towards the region of Luhansk.  In protest at such military movements into a disputed territory, the US accused Russia of not being sincere in its adherence to the terms of the 2013 ceasefire with the Ukraine. More than 4,000 people have died in this conflict with almost a million more having fled their homes since this instability erupted in April 2014.</p>

                    <h3>Crimea Incident</h3>
                    <p>The Republic of Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine jutting into the Black Sea, was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1783 and subsequently transferred to the Ukraine in 1954. After the flight of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych during the Ukrainian Revolution, an interim government in the region held a referendum on whether or not to join Russia. Though a Crimean separationist government signed a treaty of accession in March 2014 which brought Crimea into the Russian Federation, this referendum was deemed invalid by the UN and sanctions were subsequently placed on Russia. This incident significantly exacerbated relations between Russia and the West.</p>
