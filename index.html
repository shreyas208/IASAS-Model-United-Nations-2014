                    <p>Dear MUN coaches and delegates,</p>
                    <p>Greetings! It is with great pleasure that Jakarta International School welcomes you to Indonesia and to IASAS MUN 2014. Model United Nations is an activity that brings out the best in students. It requires that all participants represent a nation other than their own, and indeed that delegates argue and defend the rights and interests of this surrogate nation. It demands a great deal of its participants: deft social interaction, convincing public speaking, thorough research skills, resilience in the face of strong opposition, and stamina and focus over the course of a three-day conference. This can be challenging, especially when students disagree politically or even morally with the stance taken by this adopted nation on a certain issue. Because of this very juxtaposition, however, it creates an increased understanding of world politics and the challenges faced in trying to resolve conflicts and deal with crises.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore a good thing that MUN also seems to attract the most dedicated and talented of international students. I have never failed to be impressed by the sight of immaculately attired young men and women speaking eloquently and passionately about the issues facing our world. Poise and preparation in equal measure, along with a dash of humor and clever plays on words (or acronyms—an MUN staple) keep debate lively and delight coaches and observers. Above all, it is the delegates’ independence of thought and action that impress me most as a teacher and coach. I firmly believe that Model United Nations is an activity that has myriad benefits to students as they progress through high school and on to further study and work, and I am eager to see what this year’s conference holds. Thank you for preparing, for coming, and for participating—I wish you all a fulfilling and fun conference!</p>

                    <p><b>Selamat Datang di IASAS Model United Nations!</b></p>
                    <p>Dear IASAS MUN delegates, supervisors and esteemed guests,</p>
                    <p>It is our pleasure to host IASAS MUN this year and we welcome you to our beautiful campus. Please avail yourself of all that we have to offer and reach out for any support or assistance that you require.</p>
                    <p>MUN is one of the most popular IASAS opportunities as it truly embraces global perspectives and our international clientele. As we build leaders for the world of tomorrow, this experience is invaluable for senior students to celebrate their craft and for younger delegates to grow from our powerful role models. My thanks go out to all JIS faculty who have contributed in myriad ways to bring this significant event to fruition, and to the faculty of our visiting schools for their collaboration and support.</p>
                    <p>We invite all delegates to engage fully in this amazing experience and notice the small things during the convention as well as the obvious. Take time to branch out from your travelling group and start connections with your peers from different schools. Learn more about their lives and start to build relationships that may well continue for years to come. This is the magic of IASAS.</p>
                    <p>My best wishes to you all. May the ideas flow smoothly and words come out just right.</p>
