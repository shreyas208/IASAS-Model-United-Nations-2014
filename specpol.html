                    <p>Hi, my name is Varun Bindra and I am a senior at Singapore American School. I started MUN 4 years ago as a freshman. What appealed to me the most about MUN was the research involved and having to balance so many different competing interests when developing a stance for one’s delegation.</p>
                    <p>By no means is MUN the only thing I do. In school, I’m also in debate and Model Congress, both speech and debate activities. My favorite subject is history, especially Chinese history. I am also very much a fan of Chinese philosophy.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I like to play videogames, hike, watch TV, and read the news. I also enjoy travelling with my family and am currently excited for a hiking trip to Japan in February.</p>
                    <p>I was very excited to be chosen as a co-chair for this MUN conference and am especially happy to be in SPECPOL given my interest in global political issues.</p>

                    <p>My name is Seoyoung Lee, I’m from ISB, and this is my third year participating in IASAS MUN. I joined MUN in my freshman year not knowing exactly what it was, but soon fell in love with it: the passion showcased by all delegates, the intelligence and wit it required, and most importantly, the professionalism it asked for. I’m happy to be able to say with confidence that I have grown immensely, both as a debater and a person, through the years I’ve spent participating in MUN, and wish to continue it even in college if given the opportunity to.</p>
                    <p>In addition to IASAS MUN, I’m also involved in IASAS Cultural Convention Music, in which I play the piano and the viola. Both of these events are the highlight of my school year. I’m also a fervent human rights activist, and firmly believe that human rights come before any other value.</p>
                    <p>Although I have many other passions other than the ones already mentioned above, I’d have to say that eating is my absolute strongest one. I relish a variety of food, ranging from Thai and Korean to Italian dishes.</p>
                    <p>Since this is my last MUN conference, I’ve put in a lot of effort into getting prepared for it, and am hoping to make it the best one yet!</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The Question of Recognition of Military Regimes</h3>
                    <p>It is important to first clearly see what the question is asking; it is asking about the recognition of military regimes, not about their treatment. Thus, resolutions must address how and according to what criteria certain countries ruled by military will be recognized as legitimate and which will not. Violations of human rights and effectiveness of the governmental system are two of the factors that should be taken into account when creating resolutions.</p>
                    <p>An example could be Thailand. Thailand is currently under a military rule; in May this year, the military junta’s National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) took power through coup d’etat. This military government, the NCPO, established a military dominated national legislature which later undemocratically voted General Prayuth as a new prime minister of the country. However, despite this non-democratic means of achieving power and numerous criticisms it has received from the international community (including the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon), Thailand is still recognized as a legitimate state in the United Nations.</p><p>When crafting a resolution to this question, it is also crucial to be aware of and address the problem related to skewed, inauthentic information released by certain nations. For instance, It is estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 political prisoners are detained in concentration camps in North Korea, where they perform forced labour and risk summary beatings, torture and execution (McDonald). However, this is not brought up and confirmed by North Korea. Therefore, when thinking of solutions to this question, keep in mind that clauses calling for assessment of countries using information from those same countries may not produce the most trustworthy results.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The Question of Renewed Skirmishes in Africa</h3>
                    <p>This is a very complex question, as there are multiple conflicts taking place in Africa, and each of them is different in its nature. However, one characteristic that is in common with all of these skirmishes is that they are a result of religious, ethnic, and political dissents. As Africa had its borders drawn by European colonial rulers at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, its countries were divided up with no consideration given to the sensitive cultural implications. This resulted in incompatible ethnic and religious groups being put together as one nation, leading to disagreements and violent clashes. For example, modern Nigeria is a combination of two former British colonies, which were amalgamated in 1914 for Great Britain’s convenience. Northern Nigeria, which is now broken into several states and three geopolitical blocs, is largely Muslim. Thus, its population generally looks to the Middle East and the wider Muslim world for solidarity and sociopolitical example. On the other hand, the South, an ethnically diverse region containing many states and three geopolitical units, is largely Christian. The major sociopolitical influences there are Western and traditional African (Ochonu). Therefore, with these clearly divided religious groups inhabiting the same country, there have been many cases of Islamist-insurgency, even in March 2014, with the Islamist group Boko Haram attacking three northern Nigerian states, leaving more than three million people facing a humanitarian crisis (Boko Haram has been waging attacks since 2009 in order to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria).</p>
                    <p>Along with this root cause of the skirmishes, it is recommended to directly tackle other causes (ex. lack of respect for rule of law) by creating an effective and practical resolution. However, it is important to keep in mind that proposing to intervene in these countries may be regarded as infringement on their national sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>When narrowing down the scope of this question, as the question is specifically targeting “renewed” skirmishes in Africa, focus on conflicts that have taken place recently. The conflict between anti-balaka militias and the ex-selekas in Central African Republic (CAR), for instance, would be one to pay great attention to.</p>
                    <p>The following are the African countries in the SPECPOL committee. Take note of them and try to understand why they may have been included: <b>South Africa, CAR, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Liberia</b>.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Independence and Nationalism of Kurds</h3>
                    <p>The Kurds are members of the Kurdish ethnic group that populate Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. In each of these countries, Kurds are a significant minority, comprising 5-30% of the population and serving as a majority in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. The Kurdish people have their own language and culture and tend to identify with their own ethnic group more than the country they are living in (e.g. Iraqi Kurds will think of themselves as Kurds rather than Turks).</p>
                    <p>Much of the reason why Kurds do not feel attached to states is due to racism against them, often orchestrated by the state. For example, in Syria, Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime grants Alawites more privileges than it does to Kurds. In other Middle Eastern countries, though not state-sanctioned, the racism against Kurds similarly disenfranchises them politically.</p>
                    <p>On this issue of independence and nationalism of Kurds, delegates will have to weigh two competing interests: the desire of nation-states to have full influence over and unify their people and the desire of Kurds to create an independent country for people of their ethnic group to live as the majority (or totality) and be legally protected. Current Kurdish independence proposals involve taking land from each of the four countries where Kurds live and creating a Kurdish territory with it.</p>
