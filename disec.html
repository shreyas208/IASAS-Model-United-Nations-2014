                    <p>Hello Delegates!</p>
                    <p>My name is Navina Hasper and I’m a senior from ISM. I’ve been doing MUN for around three years now. Having attended BERMUN, BERMUN 2, THIMUN, BEIMUN and a few local conferences in Manila, I feel like I’ve been extremely privileged to interact with people from all over the world. Yes, it sounds very cliche but MUN has allowed me to grow a lot as a person and has changed my life. It has helped me gain many different political perspectives, make new friends from all over the world, as well as increase my self confidence. Lets not forget to mention the intense intellectual arguments. This will be my first IASAS MUN, but it will be my third time chairing.</p>
                    <p>However, my life is not all consumed by MUN. Whether that be a good or bad thing is up to you to decide. I also love to play tennis, do photography and dance. Just a little bit of information about me. I’m half-indian, half-german and have lived in Germany, India, Thailand and the Philippines. Hence, the interest in international relations :)</p>
                    <p>I am honored to be serving as one of your chairs for my last MUN conference, especially because I get to chair the DISEC committee. I’m sure that the chosen issues will lead to very interesting and heated debates and am very much looking forward to meeting all of you next week!</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm Sae Hun, one of your chairs for the DISEC committee. I'm a senior at Singapore American School and I've done MUN for 5 years, having participated in the MUNOFS, BEIMUN, MUNUWC and IASAS conferences as a delegate. At IASAS, I was the delegate of Pakistan of the DISEC committee. I chaired DISEC committee at MUNUWC earlier this year, meaning that this will be my second chairing experience.</p>
                    <p>My experiences in MUN have allowed to gain a better understanding of the world around me and given me an appreciation for politics and debate. MUN has also allowed me to become exposed to diverse people and a variety of interesting ideas. Overall, MUN has played a very important role in my high school life.</p>
                    <p>Outside of MUN, I like watching football, trying to play football and browsing reddit, where I can spend a couple hours a day on weekends. When I have free time, I try to eat out at my favorite restaurant, Nando's.</p>
                    <p>I am confident that this year's DISEC committee will generate intense debate and forge strong solutions to resolve some of the pressing issues that plague this world. I look forward to seeing you all and hope you will enjoy IASAS MUN 2014.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of Internet Espionage and Cybersecurity</h3>
                    <p>As the world moves into the age of the internet, the damage of internet espionage can cause and the corresponding need for importance of cybersecurity is only increasing. The rapid development of technology has increasingly rendered the existing, traditional legal systems unwieldy and obsolete. For this reason, internet espionage runs amok in today's world, from China's reported acts of cyber espionage against the USA to Israel and the United States' alleged use of the Stuxnet virus against Iran. A several questions must be raised in the solving of this issue. How much evidence should be needed to convict an entity of cyber espionage? What will be the sanctions against such entities? What measures can be placed against these very advancing acts of espionage?</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of Illicit Small Arms</h3>
                    <p>Small arms refers to weapons like revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines,   assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Because of the inherent easy to carry and conceal nature of these weapons, the trade of illicit small arms is proving to be a challenge, especially in chaotic conflict areas, where the problem is most prominent in. The harms these weapons inflict are great – thousands are killed every year due to the influx of such weapons into the mentioned conflict zones. An effective solution to problem not only account the extreme logistical difficulties inherent in this issue, but also take into factors like national sovereignty that may arise in tackling the problem.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of Private Military Companies</h3>
                    <p>PMCs (Private Military Companies) are subject to much controversy. In 2001, the United   Nations General Assembly passed the United Nations Mercenary Convention, which  prohibited the recruitment, training, use, and financing of mercenaries. Yet, it is clear that a more comprehensive solution is needed. Since the passing of the convention, nations like USA, who are not signatories to the convention, have used PMCs like Blackwater, now known as Academi, that have become embroiled in many human rights violation accusations. With this issue rapidly growing and the United Nations Mercenary Convention less relevant, it is clear that new answers regarding the legitimacy PMCs, the rules they should operate by, and the monitoring of these organizations is needed.</p>
