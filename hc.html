                    <p>Hi!</p>
                    <p>My name is Siya Agarwal, and I am a senior at Jakarta International School. I started MUN in the 9th grade just because it seemed to be a fun way to spend my time! Since then, I have been to seven conferences, and MUN has grown to mean so much more. Today, I do MUN because I truly believe in its ability to shed new perspectives on current issues.</p>
                    <p>Apart from MUN, I am also a relative newcomer to debate, with the previous year being the first I participated in the Cultural Convention. I also enjoy playing badminton, painting, and engaging in community service. My guilty pleasures include reading dystopian fiction and watching singing competitions, so feel free to strike up a conversation about any of those with me!</p>
                    <p>This year, I am the Chair of our newest committee - the Historical Committee - and am super excited to travel back in time and see if we can change the responses of the international community to certain crises. This is certainly a challenging committee that really asks delegates to step up, both by truly representing their countries, and also by actively engaging in debate. I hope that each one of you is ready to bring your A-game!</p>
                    <p>The rules of this committee are rather complicated, and so if you have any questions, feel free to find me on Facebook and send me a message!</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of the installment of nuclear weapons in Cuba, October 1963</h3>
                    <p>On October 15 of 1962, United States U-2 spy-planes took some high altitude images that showed Soviet soldiers hurriedly setting up nuclear-armed missiles. The Soviet Union had transported nuclear missiles to the island of Cuba, only 90 miles off the coast of the United States (well within the range of the missiles). For the next 13 days, the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba struggled to resolve the situation.</p>
                    <p>For some time previously the Soviets had openly been sending weaponry to Cuba, including surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles (SAMs). To deflect any criticism about this from the Republicans, Kennedy had said he would not protest about such defensive weaponry, but warned that if the Soviets ever introduced offensive weapons, 'the gravest issues would arise.' Since Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev had promised repeatedly not to send offensive weapons to Cuba, and America's top intelligence analysts had predicted that he would keep his word, Kennedy felt safe in voicing this warning. The U-2 photographs, however, showed that Khrushchev had been lying. The 'gravest issues' were at hand.</p>
                    <p>The transportation of nuclear missiles to Cuba by the Soviet Union was a Soviet response to two recent events during the Cold War. First, was the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. The Bay of Pigs was a failed military invasion of Cuba by a CIA backed counter-revolution force called Brigade 2506. Brigade 2506 was armed and trained by the CIA, and attacked Cuba on the 17th of April 1961. It was defeated by the Cuban military, and its members were interrogated. Soon after, Fidel Castro announced that Cuba planned to strengthen ties with the Soviet Union and adopt Socialism. A second reason for the presence of Soviet Missiles in Cuba was the American nuclear missiles in Turkey and Italy. These two locations put Moscow within range of a nuclear strike, and prompted the Soviets to move missiles into Cuba, within range of Washington.</p>
                    <p>For Kennedy, this transportation of missiles was not centrally about missiles in Cuba, but about Berlin. The Soviets had tried to take over West Berlin in 1948-9. Their blockade had been frustrated by an Anglo-American airlift and by the astonishing resolution of the West Berliners. In 1961, Khrushchev and the East Germans built a wall around West Berlin as a stopgap measure to halt the exodus of East Germans from Soviet-controlled areas. Earlier in 1962 he had told Kennedy that he intended to act on West Berlin as soon as the US congressional elections were over. Thus, Kennedy interpreted the installation of missiles in Cuba as a move preparatory to a showdown on Berlin (which he had sworn to protect).</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, understanding the motivations for this transportation of nuclear missiles and the interpretations of it by the involved states is central to finding a appropriate resolution to this complex and layered issue.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of partition in Palestine-Israel, 1947</h3>
                    <p>In 586 BC, the Babylonian occupation of Israel began, during which the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, an important site in Jewish history. Hundreds of years later, the Romans occupied Israel, and due to a series of revolts from the Jewish people, the Jews were scattered from Israel to all parts of the Roman Empire. The Romans then named the area “Syria Palaestina”. Over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries, there were movements for the Jews to organize themselves and immigrate back to Israel, but no attempt came to fruition. In the 19th century however, an increasing amount of anti-semitism in Europe caused the Zionist movement to gain popularity.</p>
                    <p>One plan for the rejoining of the Jewish community was The Declaration of Balfour, a Zionist plan to give all Jews a national home in their ancestral home, Palestine. The Declaration of Balfour was a British answer to the “Jewish Question”, a question on how to respond to the increasing anti-semitism in the early 20th century. The Declaration of Balfour, having been declared by British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour, an advocate for the British Zionist movement, lead to the creation of the British Mandate. The British Mandate for Palestine was the establishment of British power in the Palestinian area, meaning that the area was occupied by British troops from 1920 until 1948.</p>
                    <p>The British Mandate marked a time of immigration for many of the European Jewish communities. Between 1920 and 1948, the population of Jews within Mandatory Palestine increased from one sixth of the population to one third. A large part of the increase of Jewish immigration to the area was the increasing anti-semitism in Europe at the time, especially by the National Socialist Party of Germany that began its attempting to exterminate the Jewish race in 1941. To avoid the Holocaust, many Jews left Europe, several of which went to Mandatory Palestine. However, as Britain attempted to control immigration to Mandatory Palestine, many of the Jewish immigrants entered the country illegally. A famous example of this is the SS Exodus, a ship carrying illegal Jewish immigrants that was seized by the British Navy and sent back to Europe.</p>
                    <p>However within Mandatory Palestine, the British were met with resistance from the Arabs. In 1936, the Arab Revolt began in Palestine. It began with Palestinians protesting for an independant Jerusalem, however escalated once the British responded with bringing in more troops and taxing Palestinian homes more heavily. The Arab revolt lead to the Peel commission, an investigation into the Palestinian revolt by Lord Earl Peel, a British politician. Lord Peels report in 1937 recommended partition for Palestine.</p>
                    <p>As well as the illegal immigration of the Jews and the strike of the Arabs, Mandatory Palestine had problems with terrorism and civil fighting. The Jewish group Irgun took up arms against the Arabs, both responding to Arab attacks as well as carrying out terrorism on their own, and assisting the European Jews immigrate illegally. The group also acted against the British by bombing the King David Hotel in 1946, which at the time was the British base of operations within Palestine.</p>
                    <p>The crisis in Palestine brought the attention of the United nations, and in 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine came up with two plans. First was the majority plan, the creation of two states (one Arab and one Jewish), and the second was for the creation of an independent Jerusalem. This plan was suggested to the United Nations.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of escalating tribal disputes in Rwanda, 1994</h3>
                    <p>There were two major ethnicities in Rwanda: the Hutu (original Rwandan majority) and the Tutsi (minorities originated from Ethiopia).</p>
                    <p>When the Belgian colonists arrived at Rwanda in 1916, they introduced identity cards classifying people according to their ethnicity. They considered the Tutsis to be superior to the Hutus. Consequently, resentment among the Hutus built up and eventually culminated in a series of riots in 1959. When Belgium granted Rwanda independence in 1962, the Hutus took their place as the governing party. Over subsequent decades, the Tutsi were portrayed as the scapegoats for every crisis.</p>
                    <p>In the years approaching the genocide, the economic situation in Rwanda worsened and the incumbent Hutu president, Juvenal Habyarimana, began losing popularity. There was also the formation of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) - led by Mr Kagame - an organization that aimed to overthrow Habyarimana and secure the rights of the Hutu’s.</p>
                    <p>Tensions between Habyarimana and RPF escalated and eventually led to the formation of UNAMIR (established in the UN resolution 873), whose mandate was to assist in ensuring the security in Rwanda. Soon after, on 4th August 1993, a peace accord (The Arusha Peace Agreement) was signed by these Rwandese parties. It was the job of the UNAMIR to help implement it.</p>
                    <p>However, this accord did little to stop the continued unrest. Instead, on 6th April 1994, Habyarimana's plane was shot down. This was the final nail to the coffin. Exactly who killed the president was never established.</p>
