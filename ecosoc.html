                    <p>Hiya! I’m Dakshina Chetti and I will be one of the two chairs taking care of the ECOSOC committee this year. I am so looking forward to this year’s conference as, alas; this is my fourth and last IASAS-MUN. I have been an MUN delegate for the past 6 years, and an MUN Chair for the past four, and my school’s Deputy Secretary-General for the past year. MUN has pretty much been the core of my extracurricular life since I can remember, so I hope that will be somewhat conducive to debate in this year’s ECOSOC committee.</p>
                    <p>Just to give you a little info about me: heated debate is my #1 form of entertainment (right after binge-watching American Horror Story), I speak English, French, Spanish and Creole, and I originally come from Mauritius (though I have lived in France for seven years and in Malaysia for another seven). When I get shipped off to University (soon soon soon), I will be studying Neuroscience and Psychology, after which I’ll be going to Law school (if I don’t decide to become a professional adventurer or something of the sort).</p>
                    <p>On a more serious note, I am excited to see what wonderful debate my committee will give rise to, as this year’s topics are particularly exciting. Hopefully, I’ll be able to institute the kind of environment in which every delegate feels confident enough to speak freely, ask questions and actively represent their delegations. If anyone in my committee has any questions about anything (life and the universe—MUN too), feel free to <a href="mailto:dchetti15@iskl.edu.my">contact me</a>. :)</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of GMOs and patented seeds in relation to food security</h3>
                    <p><b>What’s the sitch?</b> With the advent of genetic sciences and the discovery of gene vectors, scientists and corporations have made great use of GMO’s, otherwise known as genetically-modified organisms. Whilst they have had some positive impacts, such as with the production of “Golden Rice” with the beta-carotene gene to help combat dietary shortages of vitamin-A in poverty-stricken areas, GMO’s have come under fire—especially in the last decade. GMO’s produce higher yields, are often insect-resistant, and are frequently used in the agricultural industry—however, the rapid growth of GMO plants on agricultural land is having serious repercussions of biodiversity, as well as causing long-term damage to agricultural soil. Additionally, issues of food-safety have been raised. Thus, GMO’s are a considerable source of debate and disagreement in the international community; causing panic amongst governments right down to the industries that produce said organisms.</p>
                    <p>The problem today with patented seeds is they give the “creator” of the produce the opportunity to commercialize their invention and to acquire a return on their commitment of time and money. If plant breeders are not able to commercialize on their produce, there is less of an incentive for them to work at generating new breeds of plants.</p>
